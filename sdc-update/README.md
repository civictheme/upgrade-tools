This tool will modify or replace:
- `package.json` dependencies and scripts
- `build.js` dev compilation tools
- `.storybook` configuration files
- `component` structure - component namespaces will be changed, schema files created, CSS will be compiled

## Troubleshooting

### Check the logs if any errors in running

Every step of this update script is logged in `.logs`. Review this log for any unexpected results or breaks in the
update script.

### Site is now breaking after rendering

There is an error in 1 or more of your components. You will need to check logs to see which component 
is throwing an error.

This is likely to happen so please note that this script just brings you much closer to completing the update
but will not complete it completely.

Recommend installing [SDC Devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/sdc_devel) and running the drush command
to check for errors within your component and manually fixing. Note this is also a style tool and will
uncover many warnings that do not affect the functionality of your site, start by fixing the errors
that are breaking your site first.

### Support

The script is provided as-is and is not guaranteed to work flawlessly, welcome contributions and
debugging and test cases. Please let us know how these scripts go and whether they helped or hindered
your update.

More debugging notes are appreciated in this README.md so if you have tips please let us know in 
#civictheme-designsystem.
