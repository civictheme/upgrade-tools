Implementation Plan: Step-by-Step Features

Let's break down the implementation into manageable steps, each delivering a specific feature that you can validate:

1. Project Setup

Deliverables:
- Basic project structure with directories
- package.json with dependencies
- ESLint configuration
- README with project overview

What to Validate:
- Project initializes correctly
- Dependencies install without errors
- Directory structure is as expected

2. Configuration Management

Deliverables:
- config.js module with .env file management
- Functions to get/set configuration
- Interactive configuration wizard

What to Validate:
- Configuration can be saved to .env file
- Configuration can be loaded from .env file
- Validation for required fields works

3. Sub-theme Validation

Deliverables:
- validators.js with validateSubThemeDirectory function
- Directory search functionality
- Tests for validation logic

What to Validate:
- Valid CivicTheme sub-themes are correctly identified
- Invalid directories are rejected with clear error messages
- Edge cases are handled properly

4. Logging System

Deliverables:
- logger.js with console and file logging
- Support for different log levels
- Auto-creation of log directory

What to Validate:
- Logs are written to console and file
- Log files are created with correct naming
- Different log levels work correctly

5. Main CLI Interface

Deliverables:
- index.js with main menu using inquirer/prompts
- Integration with configuration system
- Colorful and user-friendly output

What to Validate:
- Menu displays correctly with options
- Navigation between options works
- User feedback is clear and helpful

6. Update Script Integration

Deliverables:
- updateRunner.js to wrap original script
- Logging hooks for all key operations
- Error handling and status reporting

What to Validate:
- Original script functionality is preserved
- Progress is properly logged
- Errors are caught and handled gracefully

7. Final Testing and Polish

Deliverables:
- Comprehensive test suite
- Documentation updates
- Final UI/UX improvements

What to Validate:
- All tests pass
- Complete workflow functions end-to-end
- User experience is intuitive and friendly

First Implementation Task

The first task would be Project Setup and Configuration Management:

1. Create the basic directory structure
2. Set up package.json with dependencies
3. Implement the config.js module for .env management
4. Add basic configuration wizard

With this foundation in place, you can validate the initial setup works before moving on to implement the sub-theme validation and other components.
